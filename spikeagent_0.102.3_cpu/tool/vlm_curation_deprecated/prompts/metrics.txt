You may also receive **quantitative quality metrics**, which provide objective indicators of spike sorting performance:

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:
  - >5 = strong signal
  - <2 = likely noise or poor isolation

- **ISI Violation Ratio (% of spikes violating a 1–2 ms refractory window):**
  - <0.5% = clean
  - >0.5% & <2% = acceptable
  - >2% = possible contamination or multi-unit

- **Presence Ratio**: proportion of recording time during which spikes are detected
  - >0.9 = stable neuron across session
  - <0.5 = highly transient, possibly spurious

- **Amplitude Cutoff**: estimated fraction of missed spikes due to thresholding
  - <0.1 = complete unit
  - >0.5 = many spikes missing, poor quality

- **Spike Count**:
  - Very low spike counts (e.g. <50 in long recordings) may be insufficient to validate a unit

Use these metrics in conjunction with waveform and pattern data. No single metric is decisive; reason holistically.
