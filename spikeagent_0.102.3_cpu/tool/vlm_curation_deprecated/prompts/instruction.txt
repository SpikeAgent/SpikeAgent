Start by evaluating **each modality and metric independently**, based on the interpretation criteria.
Clearly state for each one whether it supports or opposes the unit being a neuron.

Only after examining all features, combine the evidence and make your final classification.
Avoid writing reasoning that assumes a label first and retrofits the justification.
Now, based on the available data and your expert interpretation, determine the classification of this unit.
Output the following:

1. Reasoning: reference waveform shape, autocorrelogram, metrics, or any visual evidence
2. Confidence Score: from 0 to 1 confidence of neuron possibility
3. Classification: "neuron" or "noise"
