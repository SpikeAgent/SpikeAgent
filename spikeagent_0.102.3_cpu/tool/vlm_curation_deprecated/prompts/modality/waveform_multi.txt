When **multi-channel average waveforms** (i.e., templates) are available, evaluate the **spatial footprint** across adjacent electrodes. A well-isolated neuron should produce a strong peak on one or two nearby electrodes with decreasing amplitudes on farther channels — this reflects localized current source density.

Neuron indicators:
- One dominant channel with the largest negative peak
- Surrounding channels show similar shape but reduced amplitude (typically spatially symmetric)
- Time-aligned peaks across channels

Noise indicators:
- Uniformly low amplitudes across channels
- No spatial gradient or focal pattern
- Inconsistent polarity or waveform shapes

Spatial coherence and focal energy concentration are strong evidence for single-unit activity.
