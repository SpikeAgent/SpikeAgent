An **amplitude over time plot** displays the peak amplitude of each spike on the y-axis over the duration of the recording.

Neuron indicators:
- Relatively stable amplitude across time
- Gradual changes (e.g. drift) are acceptable
- Persistent spiking throughout the session

Noise indicators:
- Erratic, discontinuous amplitudes
- Abrupt amplitude drop-off or disappearance
- Strong downward trends without recovery

This modality reflects unit **stability** and isolation quality. Consistent spike amplitude supports a stable neuron.
