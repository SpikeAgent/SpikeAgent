**Spike location scatter plots** visualize the estimated position of each detected spike in physical space (colored with green. grey is from different units)

Neuron indicators:
- Tight, localized cluster of spike locations
- Consistency in spatial origin across time
- Centered near a plausible neuron site on probe layout

Noise indicators:
- Widely scattered spike locations
- No clear center or multiple clusters
- Edge effects or random spread

Clustering implies spikes originate from a single neuron, while broad dispersion suggests detection artifacts or instability.
