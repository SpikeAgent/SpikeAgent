If a **single-channel average waveform** is provided, assess its morphology and amplitude. A genuine extracellular action potential from a neuron typically displays a sharp **biphasic** or **triphasic** waveform: a fast negative peak followed by a slower positive rebound.

Key neuron indicators:
- High amplitude (>40 µV, depending on SNR)
- Consistent, smooth shape with distinct negative and positive phases

Noise indicators:
- Low amplitude close to background fluctuations
- Irregular or flat shape, absence of a clear peak
- Temporal jitter between spikes

The presence of a stereotyped, repeatable waveform shape supports the "neuron" classification.
