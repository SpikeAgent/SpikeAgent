The **autocorrelogram** reveals the unit’s temporal firing pattern. A well-isolated single neuron will exhibit a **refractory period**, meaning it cannot fire two spikes within ~1–2 ms.

Neuron indicators:
- Prominent central trough around 0 ms
- Near-zero spike counts for time lags <2 ms
- Periodic structure (e.g. rhythmic bursting)

Noise or multi-unit indicators:
- No visible refractory period
- High number of spikes within <1–2 ms intervals
- Flat or noisy histogram

Violation of the refractory period indicates contamination or non-neuronal activity. Use this feature to assess unit purity.
